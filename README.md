# Magnetic Car Project

---

The goal of this project is to create a magnetically-propelled vehicle which runs along a fixed track. 
This is managed using a series of electromagnets embedded in the track to pull the car along a given path. The presence of the
car is detected using hall effect sensors that sense the magnetic field of the car's strong neodymium magnets. This detection
event is used to signal the activation of an electromagnet which creates an attractive force that pulls the car forward.
